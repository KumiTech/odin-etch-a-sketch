# 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project is a browser-based sketch pad, similar to an "Etch-a-Sketch," created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on DOM manipulation and event listeners.

The user can draw on a dynamic grid of squares by hovering their mouse over them. The user can also reset the grid to a new size.



## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Grid:** A default 16x16 grid is generated by JavaScript upon page load.
* **Hover Effect:** Moving the mouse over the grid squares changes their background color, "drawing" a trail.
* **Customizable Grid Size:** A "Resize" button allows the user to clear the grid and generate a new one with a custom size (e.g., "64" for a 64x64 grid).
* **Performance Limit:** User input for grid size is capped at 100x100 to prevent browser lag or crashes.
* **Extra Credit:** The hover effect can be set to generate a random RGB color for each square, creating a "rainbow" trail.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Provides the basic page structure, including the main container and the resize button.
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling.
* **Flexbox:** Used specifically (as per project requirements) to arrange the dynamically created `div` elements into a responsive grid.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all the core logic:
    * DOM Manipulation (creating, appending, and removing grid squares)
    * Event Listeners (`click` for the button, `mouseover` for the grid squares)
    * User Input (via `prompt()`)

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project was a key exercise in practicing fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Learning how to create and append elements to the DOM entirely from a script.
* **Event Handling:** Attaching event listeners to elements (both existing and dynamically created) to create interactive user experiences.
* **CSS Layout with Flexbox:** Using Flexbox to manage a grid of unknown size and ensure it scales correctly within a fixed-size container.
* **Problem-Solving:** Debugging the logic for removing and regenerating the grid without reloading the page.
* **Combining Logic:** Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a cohesive and functional web application.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Move your mouse over the grid to start drawing.
3.  Click the **"Resize Grid"** button at the top.
4.  Enter a new number (1-100) when prompted to create a new grid.
